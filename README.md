# CloudMap Kubernetes Controller

A lightweight Kubernetes controller that integrates Kubernetes **headless services** with **AWS Cloud Map** to enable seamless **service discovery**, compatible with **existing ECS-based architectures**.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

In our current infrastructure, we operate **~200 services** on **Amazon ECS**, utilizing **AWS Cloud Map** for service discovery, which in turn creates Route 53 DNS records for those ECS services.

However, we faced the following operational challenges:

- ❌ **Code Modification Requirement:**
  Developers were expected to manually update service endpoint references in code. This was **time-consuming** and **error-prone**.

- ❓ **Unknown Dependencies:**
  We lacked visibility into which services consumed others via DNS. Accidental changes could **break production workloads**.

- 📈 **Scalability Concerns:**
  With hundreds of services, **manual intervention** became unmanageable and risky.

## ✅ Solution Approach

We decided to **migrate workloads to EKS**, but we wanted to **retain Cloud Map** as the central discovery mechanism. This would ensure **backward compatibility** without requiring any code changes.

### Tried: ExternalDNS
We initially evaluated [`external-dns`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns), which works well for public domains. However:

- It **requires a resolvable DNS domain name** (e.g., `abc.example.com`)
- In our case, Cloud Map used namespaces like `test-namespace` (i.e., not tied to a public domain)
- As a result, `external-dns` **could not find the namespace** and **skipped registration**

## 🛠️ What This Controller Does

This custom controller addresses the above challenges by:

- ✅ Automatically registering **headless services** in AWS Cloud Map
- ✅ Preserving service **hostnames** as-is (`nginx-service` in `test-namespace`)
- ✅ Supporting **cross-namespace service discovery**
- ✅ Handling **replica scaling events** (Pod IPs update automatically)
- ✅ Cleaning up **stale IPs** when pods go offline
- ✅ Performing **drift detection** every 60s to re-sync any Cloud Map inconsistencies
- ✅ Stale IP cleanup
- ✅ Performing **Conflict resolution** (multiple services claiming same DNS name)

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. You create a Kubernetes **headless service** (ClusterIP: None) with annotations:

```yaml
annotations:
  cloudmap.controller/namespace: "test-namespace"
  cloudmap.controller/hostname: "nginx-service"
```

2. The controller watches for:
   - `Service` creation/deletion events
   - `Endpoints` events to track pod IPs

3. For each matching service:
   - Creates a Cloud Map service (if it doesn't exist)
   - Registers all pod IPs as `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4` records
   - Performs **drift reconciliation** periodically (re-registers deleted records)

4. Deletion of services automatically:
   - De-registers Cloud Map records
   - Releases domain ownership tracking

## ☘️ How to Deploy the Controller on Kubernetes

### 1. Build and Push Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t <your-dockerhub>/cloudmap-controller:latest .
docker push <your-dockerhub>/cloudmap-controller:latest
```

### 2. Create Kubernetes Resources

#### Namespace
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: kube-system
```

### 3. Create IAM Role & Policies (IRSA)

> IAM Role Trusted entities Policy

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.<region>.amazonaws.com/id/<oidc_id>"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "oidc.eks.<region>.amazonaws.com/id/<oidc_id>:sub": [
            "system:serviceaccount:kube-system:cloudmap-controller"
          ],
          "oidc.eks.<region>.amazonaws.com/id/<oidc_id>:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
        }
      }
    }

## 📊 Observability

This controller emits Kubernetes `Events` that can be viewed via:
```bash
kubectl get events -n <namespace>

# controller logs
kubectl logs deploy/cloudmap-controller -n kube-system -f
```

Example:
- `Registered 172.16.10.45 to nginx-service`
- `Deregistered stale IP 172.16.12.110 from nginx-service`
- `DomainConflict: nginx-service already claimed by other service`
